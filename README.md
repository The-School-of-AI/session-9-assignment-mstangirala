 # TUPLES & NAMED TUPLES

## Tuples: are containers of information.....order matters......and it's both heterogeneous and homogeneous.

They are indexable and iterable

It is immutable

It is of fixed length and fixed order

In-place sorting is not possible

In-place reversals are not possible

Good for representing data structures like 3D

Tuple helps in having meaning of data based on position

The order of elements cannot be changed.

It works well for representing data structures.


## Dummy Variables:

Eg: "_" It is a legal variable name.

It is used in extended unpacking.


## Named Tuples:

Self documenting code.
They allow to assign property names to the positional elements which makes the tuple
more flexible without breaking.

It can be imported from collections module.

The output after using a named tuple is still a tuple and it acts as a subclass
of the main tuple.

Named tuple is immutable just like tuple.

Named tuple is a class factory.
